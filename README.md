# React-with-Code-and-Chai
# here i have all my learning stuff from none to hero.
# in order to run any of these projects in you native computer, follow these steps:

  #1. Open terminal on your desired directory(or navigate to it in terminal itself) 
  #2. create a react project using vite by executing  
      npm create vite
      (name the project as per your need and select React with JavaScript)
  #3. open change directory to the newly added one(created by you) and run:
      npm install
  #4. easily replace the src and index file from the project of your choice from the repository
  #5. in the terminal, execute
      npm run dev
      and open the link you have
#Voila there you have it

# Important:
  make sure you have node and npm install on you desktop
# IN case the projects dont work, just check the version of your node, match it with version with the version of node in my_repo and try again
# you can check the version in package.json
